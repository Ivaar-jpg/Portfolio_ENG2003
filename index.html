											<h1>Hi, I’m Ivor </h1>
											<p>This website was developed for my ENG2003 Course Term Project</p>
										</header>
										<p>Through coursework, I’ve built skills in technical writing, professional communication, and structured problem-solving, while also gaining hands-on experience in projects such as energy storage research, 3D printing and laser cutting, and team-based design competitions. Beyond academics, I serve as VP External for the Lassonde Engineering Society, where I represent students at conferences, build networks with engineering leaders across Canada, and strengthen my leadership and communication skills. I am passionate about applying engineering knowledge to real-world challenges, developing as a communicator and leader, and contributing meaningfully to my community.</p>

                <h3>Showcase #1 — Technical Report (ENG2003)</h3>
                <p>
                  I selected my technical report for this course because it allowed me to further develop my
                  skills in structured and professional writing. Back in high school, I had written major projects
                  in mathematics (e.g., a thesis on predator-prey models using Canadian lynx and hare data) and
                  in philosophy (how different forms of representation affect interpretation). Those experiences
                  gave me an initial base but also revealed gaps in my ability. Writing a technical report again,
                  this time on energy storage solutions for renewable energy, gave me the chance to see how
                  much I had grown. I explored technologies such as sand batteries, lithium-ion, and pumped
                  hydro to address intermittency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This piece showed how my communication has matured. Learning the 7 C’s helped me organize and
                  present complex information with clarity, conciseness, and coherence. The shorter timeline pushed
                  me out of my comfort zone, and peer-reviewing/marking made me more critical of my own work.
                  While I could have created original graphs and deepened analysis, this remains a milestone in my
                  development as a communicator.

              <!-- Showcase #2 -->
              <article>
                <h3>Showcase #2 — Mock Interview (ENG2003)</h3>
                <p>
                  I chose the interview assignment because it was practical and eye-opening. It revealed how much
                  I still had to learn about presenting myself effectively in professional contexts. Although I
                  considered myself a strong communicator, I lacked confidence and structure when speaking about
                  myself. Public speaking and interviews were outside my comfort zone, but this exercise forced me
                  to confront weaknesses directly and provided valuable lessons for my ongoing development.

              <!-- Showcase #3 -->
              <article>
                <h3>Showcase #3 — Two Handouts for Different Audiences (ENG2003)</h3>
                <p>
                  This project taught me to tailor communication to audience needs—adjusting language and tone,
                  not just content. I enjoyed the creative aspects (graphics and layout) but the hardest part was
                  internalizing how audience expectations shape communication choices. Despite some formatting hiccups
                  at export and relying more on text than visuals, the piece marked strong progress in audience-aware
                  writing.

              <!-- Showcase #4 -->
              <article>
                <h3>Showcase #4 — Conferences & Communication</h3>
                <p>
                  I attended three major conferences this year:
                  CFES’s Canadian Engineering Leadership Conference (UNB, Fredericton) with policy discussions and a
                  visit to the Mactaquac Dam; Ontario Engineering Competition (McMaster) where my team built a
                  self-sailing vessel under time pressure; and ESSCO Presidents’ Meeting (Carleton) as VP External
                  for the Lassonde Engineering Society. Each pushed me in networking, public speaking, and leadership,
                  strengthening my communication in diverse settings.
                </p>

              <!-- Passion Project -->
              <article>
                <h3>Passion Project — Trophy Design & Fabrication</h3>
                <p>
                  I revived and improved a tradition: trophies for Frosh Week and the York Engineering Competition.
                  With no documentation left from a past effort, I reverse-engineered the process: sketches inspired
                  by a space-themed concept, 3D-printed prototypes, then laser-cut black/gold acrylic finals so
                  every member of the winning teams received one. It demanded resourcefulness, experimentation,
                  and clear communication to align peers and secure support—combining creativity, technical skill,
                  and leadership with tangible community impact.
