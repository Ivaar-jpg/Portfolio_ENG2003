											<h1>Hi, I’m Ivor </h1>
											<p>This website was developed for my ENG2003 Course Term Project</p>
										</header>
										<p>Through coursework, I’ve built skills in technical writing, professional communication, and structured problem-solving, while also gaining hands-on experience in projects such as energy storage research, 3D printing and laser cutting, and team-based design competitions. Beyond academics, I serve as VP External for the Lassonde Engineering Society, where I represent students at conferences, build networks with engineering leaders across Canada, and strengthen my leadership and communication skills. I am passionate about applying engineering knowledge to real-world challenges, developing as a communicator and leader, and contributing meaningfully to my community.</p>

              <!-- Showcase #1 -->
              <article>
                <h3>Showcase #1 — Technical Report (ENG2003)</h3>
                <p>I selected my technical report for this course because it allowed me to further develop my skills in structured and professional writing. Back in high school, I had written major projects in mathematics, such as a thesis on predator-prey models using Canadian lynx and hare data, and in philosophy, where I explored how different forms of representation affect interpretation. Those experiences gave me an initial base but also revealed gaps in my ability. Writing a technical report again, this time on energy storage solutions for renewable energy, gave me the chance to see how much I had grown. In this report, I explored technologies such as sand batteries, lithium-ion, and pumped hydro to address the intermittency challenge of renewables.</p>

<p>This piece showed how my communication has matured. Before this class, my writing relied
heavily on knowledge and experience without a structured framework. Learning the 7 C’s of
Communication helped me better organize and present complex information with clarity,
conciseness, and coherence. It also pushed me out of my comfort zone, as the timeline was much
shorter compared to the months I had for high school projects. Additionally, reviewing and
grading my peers’ reports forced me to think more critically about my own work. While this was
not my best piece, as I could have created original graphs and focused more deeply on analysis,
it stands as an important milestone in my development as a communicator.</p>

              <!-- Showcase #2 -->
              <article>
                <h3>Showcase #2 — Mock Interview (ENG2003)</h3>
                   <p> I chose the interview assignment because it was one of the most practical and eye-opening experiences of the course. It revealed how much I still had to learn about presenting myself effectively, especially in professional contexts such as job applications. While I had believed I was already a strong communicator, this exercise showed me where I lacked confidence and structure, particularly in speaking about myself.
				   </p>
				  <p>
This assignment was definitely outside my comfort zone, as public speaking and interviews have always been areas where I feel less confident. However, it provided an opportunity for growth by forcing me to confront those weaknesses directly. Although this was not my strongest work, as I made mistakes I could have avoided, the lessons I took away from it were invaluable for my ongoing development as a communicator.

              <!-- Showcase #3 -->
              <article>
                <h3>Showcase #3 — Two Handouts for Different Audiences (ENG2003)</h3>
                <p> I selected the handout project because it represented one of my stronger assignments and taught me a critical lesson about tailoring communication to different audiences. In creating this piece, I worked hard to adapt the same information for two different audiences, which required a change not only in language but also tone.</p>
				  
				  <p>While I enjoyed the creative aspects of designing the handout, especially since I am comfortable working with graphics and layouts, the most challenging part was learning how audience expectations completely shape communication choices. The final product could have been stronger, as formatting errors occurred during the export process and I relied more on text than visuals. Even so, this piece showed how much I had progressed in thinking about audience needs, and it’s an important step in my development toward being a better communicator. </p>

              <!-- Showcase #4 -->
              <article>
                <h3>Showcase #4 — Conferences & Communication</h3>
                <p> This past year, I had the opportunity to attend three major conferences, each of which pushed me to grow as a communicator and leader. At the Canadian Engineering Leadership Conference (CELC) hosted by CFES (Canadian Federation of Engineering Students) at the university of new Brunswick (Fredericton), I learned from student leaders across the country, attended sessions on leadership and growth, explored the Mactaquac Dam project, and participated in policy discussions at the CFES annual general meeting. Later that same month, at the Ontario Engineering Competition (OEC) in McMaster, I competed in the junior design category, where my team was tasked with building a self-sailing vessel. Although we did not perform as well as hoped, the experience tested my teamwork under pressure and gave me valuable insights. Finally in July, as VP External for the Lassonde Engineering Society, I attended the ESSCO Presidents’ Meeting at Carleton, where I networked with executives from other engineering societies and gained tools to become a stronger leader.</p>

				<p> These experiences show my growth as a communicator, from initially struggling with confidence to becoming more comfortable networking and speaking in diverse settings. Each conference pushed me out of my comfort zone in different ways, whether through professional networking, public speaking, or team competition. Collectively, they represent some of my best work, not because they were flawless, but because they required me to consistently step outside my comfort zone and improve.

              <!-- Passion Project -->
              <article>
                <h3>Passion Project — Trophy Design & Fabrication</h3>
                <p>
                  I revived and improved a tradition: trophies for Frosh Week and the York Engineering Competition.
                  With no documentation left from a past effort, I reverse-engineered the process: sketches inspired
                  by a space-themed concept, 3D-printed prototypes, then laser-cut black/gold acrylic finals so
                  every member of the winning teams received one. It demanded resourcefulness, experimentation,
                  and clear communication to align peers and secure support—combining creativity, technical skill,
                  and leadership with tangible community impact.
