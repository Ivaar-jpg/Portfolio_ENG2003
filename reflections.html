              <h3>Part I – Reflections on My Experiences in ENG 2003</h3>
              <p>My overall experience in ENG 2003 has been extremely positive. This course exposed me to
              new tools and frameworks that I likely would not have learned on my own, such as strategies for
              interviews, resume and cover letter writing, updating LinkedIn, and compiling a professional
              portfolio. These skills are not only essential for engineering practice but also highly practical for
              everyday life as a student moving towards co-op placements and professional opportunities. I
              now feel much more prepared to present myself effectively in job applications and networking
              situations.</p>

              <p>At first, I expected ENG 2003 to be more generic, with fewer assignments and a heavier focus on
              theory. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was far more interactive and assignment-driven.
              The hands-on projects and practical tasks were more engaging than a traditional lecture-style
              course (I also really liked the Kahoot quizzes in class). I particularly enjoyed the fact that the
              assignments and tutorials allowed me to apply concepts immediately. For example, when we
              practiced interviews and worked on resumes, I could see the direct impact these exercises would
              have on my future career path.</p>

              <p>The most useful content, without a doubt, was related to job applications and essential
              communication skills. Resume writing, interview preparation, and portfolio development are
              tools that I will carry with me long after this course. They are deeply connected to the 7 C’s of
              Communication, because each of these principles directly applies to how one writes a resume,
              answers interview questions, or prepares a professional document. In particular, I found it eye-
              opening to realize how small adjustments in clarity and tone could dramatically change how an
              employer perceives me.</p>

              <p>In terms of interest, I found the interview and presentation components to be the most engaging.
              These activities went beyond written communication and forced me to consider nonverbal
              elements such as tone, body language, and confidence. They connected well to the Axioms of
              Communication, such as “one cannot not communicate.” Even when I was silent, my body
              language and expressions still communicated something to the audience. This realization
              encouraged me to be more intentional about how I present myself in high-stakes situations (like
              during interviews and meetings).</p>

              <p>Overall, ENG 2003 exceeded my expectations. It challenged me, but in a way that was
              constructive and rewarding. It balanced theory with practice, and as a result, I gained not just
              knowledge but applicable skills that I have already begun using in academic, professional, and
              extracurricular contexts.</p>

              <h3>Part II – Reflections on My Growth as a Communicator</h3>
              <p>Before taking ENG 2003, I would have described my communication abilities as adequate but
              unstructured. Most of my skills came from past experiences and informal feedback from others,
              rather than from a framework of principles. I could usually get my point across, but I did not
              fully understand why certain approaches worked better than others. For example, in report
              writing, I often relied on trial and error instead of having clear standards to guide me.</p>

              <p>Through this course, I gained a stronger foundation in communication by learning both the
              Axioms of Communication and the 7 C’s. These frameworks gave me language to analyse my
              communication more critically. For instance, when preparing a presentation, I now ask myself
              whether my content is clear, concise, and coherent. I also keep in mind that communication is
              irreversible—once I speak, I cannot take back what I have said—which has made me more mindful
              in interviews and professional conversations.</p>

              <p>The skill I improved the most was presentation and oral communication. While I already had
              some ability in report writing, I struggled with public speaking and interviews. ENG 2003 gave
              me a structure for how to prepare, present, and adjust my delivery. I became more aware of how
              tone, pace, and body language affect how my message is received. This helped me feel more
              confident and relaxed during interviews, which in turn made my answers stronger and more
              authentic.</p>

              <p>Another area of growth was peer review and critical evaluation. Reviewing other students’ reports
              forced me to think more critically about my own writing. I learned to identify areas of
              improvement not only in others’ work but also in my own, which sharpened my ability to revise
              and improve my communication products.</p>

              <p>That said, I still have areas to work on. I need to continue developing my confidence in high-
              pressure speaking situations, such as interviews and networking events. Although I have
              improved, I sometimes still second-guess myself or rely too heavily on prepared answers. In
              addition, I want to rely more on visuals and graphics in my written work to make it more
              engaging, as I noticed in some of my assignments that I leaned too much on text.</p>

              <p>This course will influence the way I approach both future coursework and professional practice.
              In other engineering courses, I now know what to prioritize when preparing reports and
              presentations, and I have frameworks to guide me toward producing higher-quality work.
              Beyond the classroom, I have already begun applying what I learned to my role as VP External
              of the Lassonde Engineering Society. In this role, I interact with organizations, represent students
              at conferences, and build networks with other leaders. The lessons from ENG 2003 have made
              me more effective in these contexts, particularly when it comes to networking and presenting
              myself as a professional.</p>

              <p>Most importantly, ENG 2003 has changed how I see communication overall. I no longer view it
              as something instinctive or secondary but as a deliberate, structured process that can always be
              improved. The course taught me that communication is not just about expressing ideas but about
              making sure they are received, understood, and meaningful (to have impact/intent).</p>
