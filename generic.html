              <h1>Part I — Reflections on My Experiences in ENG 2003</h1>
            </header>

            <p>
              My overall experience in ENG 2003 has been extremely positive. This course exposed me to
              new tools and frameworks I likely wouldn’t have learned on my own—interview strategies,
              resume and cover letter writing, LinkedIn updates, and assembling a professional portfolio.
              These skills are essential for engineering practice and practical for co-op and early-career steps.
            </p>
            <p>
              I expected a theory-heavy, generic course; instead, it was interactive and assignment-driven
              (and yes, the Kahoot quizzes were fun). Hands-on tasks—mock interviews, resume building—
              showed immediate, real-world impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most useful content centered on job applications and the 7 C’s of Communication.
              Small changes in clarity and tone can shift how an employer perceives you.
              Presentation activities also highlighted the Axioms of Communication (e.g., “one cannot not communicate”)
              and the importance of nonverbal cues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the course exceeded expectations, balancing theory and practice and equipping me
              with stronger communication skills I’m already applying in academics, co-curriculars, and beyond.

              <h1>Part II — Reflections on My Growth as a Communicator</h1>
            </header>

            <p>
              Before ENG 2003, my communication was adequate but unstructured—driven by experience rather
              than principles. Learning the Axioms and the 7 C’s gave me language and benchmarks to plan,
              evaluate, and revise my work.
            </p>
            <p>
              My biggest gains were in oral presentation and interviews: awareness of tone, pace, and body language,
              and a clearer prep structure led to more confident, authentic delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Peer review sharpened my ability to spot gaps in others’ work and my own. I still want to build more
              confidence in high-pressure speaking and use more visuals to make documents more engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m already applying these lessons as VP External at the Lassonde Engineering Society—representing students,
              networking with other leaders, and preparing professional communications. Most of all, I now treat
              communication as a deliberate, improvable process focused on impact and understanding.
